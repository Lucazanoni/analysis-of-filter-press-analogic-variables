# Analysis of analogic data in Automatic Plate and Frame Filter Presses
## Filter Press
A filter press is a piece of equipment used in liquid/solid separation. 
Specifically, the filter press separates the liquids and solids using pressure filtration, 
wherein a slurry is pumped into the filter press and is dewatered under pressure. 
Basically, each filter press is designed based on the volume and type of slurry that needs to be dewatered.
### Working
The working principle of filter presses is that slurry is pumped into the machine such that solids are distributed evenly during the fill cycle. 
Solids build up on the filter cloth, forming the filter cake; 
the filtrate exits the filter plates through the corner ports into the manifold, yielding clean filtered water.
Filter presses are a pressure filtration method and as such, as the filter press feed pump builds pressure, 
solids build within the chambers until they are completely chock-full of solids, forming the cake. 
Once the chambers are full, the cycle is complete and the filter cakes are ready to be released. 
In many higher capacity filter presses, fast action automatic plate shifters are employed, speeding cycle time.
